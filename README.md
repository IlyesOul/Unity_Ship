# Unity_Ship

This is Project Boost!

This is my very own game that I made in Unity using both its software as well as C#. 
Objectively, you fly a rocket ship through different obstacles that change every level, and there's a set amount of levels.

This game is heavily physics-based and  has a lot of visual effects (brace your ears if you're using headphones!)

The C# code can be found in Project Boost -> Assets -> Scripts
